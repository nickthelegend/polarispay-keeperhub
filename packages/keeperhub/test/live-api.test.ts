/**
 * Live integration test against the real KeeperHub API.
 *
 *   node --test --experimental-strip-types test/live-api.test.ts
 *
 * The rest of the suite runs against stubbed transport, which proves the client
 * is internally consistent but not that it speaks the protocol the server
 * actually speaks. These tests hit https://app.keeperhub.com for real.
 *
 * Everything here works without credentials. With no API key the reachable
 * surface is the unauthenticated one -- the x402 resource catalogue and the
 * shape of a rejected request -- so that is what is asserted: that the real
 * server's 401 is classified as `auth` by the real client, and that a bad key
 * fails fast rather than being retried.
 *
 * When KEEPERHUB_API_KEY is present the authenticated checks run too. They are
 * skipped rather than failed when it is absent, so this file is safe in CI.
