/**
 * Keeper health.
 *
 * The failure mode that costs the most is not a keeper that errors — errors get
 * noticed. It is a keeper that stops. Nothing throws, no alert fires, and money
 * quietly stops moving until a merchant asks where their settlement is.
 *
 * So the signal here is the *absence* of work: a heartbeat written on every
 * pass, and a staleness check that treats silence as an incident. Everything
 * else — collection rate, overdue instalments, settlement backlog — is derived
 * from the book rather than self-reported, so a keeper cannot report itself
 * healthy while failing.
